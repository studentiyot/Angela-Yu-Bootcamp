  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>Hi World! üëã</h2>
  <p>My name is Mazal Bohbot Berrie. I'm from City Colleges of Chicago, pursuing the Web Development track, Associate in Applied Science.</p>

  <p>I have an interest in UX/UI design as well as coding. Currently, I'm studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a close interest in the development stack and toolchain used to help new learners overcome obstacles when starting out.</p>

  <p>I like to engage in different communities and enjoy participating in design challenges, puzzles, and problem-solving competitions. I'm currently running a Discord channel serving as a hub for my CIS cohort. This initiative allows us to collaborate, share resources, and support each other's knowledge path. I'm passionate about fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment.</p>

  <p>Technology moves fast! In this rapid landscape, I advocate for a ‚Äúslow tech‚Äù philosophy, embracing a lean web approach. I aim to establish or contribute to a boutique firm crafting tailored web experiences for artists, micro-businesses, and non-profits.</p>
